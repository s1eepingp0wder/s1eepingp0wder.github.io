  <h2>Favourite Blur Songs</h2>

            <div><h3>Beetlebum</h3>
              <p>I love this song because the riffs are amazing. Damon does a great job explaining the effect of addiction on oneself and others. I relate closely to this song. I use it to cope with my own issues.</p>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Boys and Girls</h3>
              <p>I love Boys and Girls because it explores bisexuality. I wasn't sure on my sexuality for the longest time but then I learned I was bi. I felt pretty bad at first, like I was greedy or looking for attention. Boys and Girls is a positive song, and it promotes self-love.</p>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Coffee and TV</h3>
              <p>This song gives me recovery vibes. It reminds me of bouncing back from something traumatic. Starting new. Healing and stuff. It reminds me of becoming a better person and emerging even stronger than before.</p>
