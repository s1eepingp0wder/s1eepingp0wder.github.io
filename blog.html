    <h3>Hello, Blog.</h3>
    <p><strong>Topic: </strong> General </p>
    <hr />
    <p>I finally got a blog going on this page. I want to use this page to talk about events in my life and honing my development skills. Luckily here, there's no means of comments.</p>

    <p>Hello, World!</p>

      <h3>Hello, Toronto.</h3>
      <p><strong>Topic: </strong> <img class="bloglogo" src="images/logos/gorillaz.png" alt="Gorillaz"> </p>
      <hr>
    <p>On October 6th, I finally got packed and headed out to Philly to start my trip out to Toronto, Ontario. I was going there to see Gorillaz, specifically. This current tour, The Now now Tour, seems to be the final one for quite a while. We don't know if Gorillaz will actually be gone for a decade, all we know is it'll be a while.</p>

    <p>I went by bus from Philadelphia to Toronto, which was a 12 hour trip. Apparently, the time would've been longer by train. The bus departed and traveled overnight and we stopped no more than 4 times. We got to stretch and see Northwestern Pennsylvania twice, Buffalo New York, and right outside the America-Canada border.</p>

    <p>I met with Emil, my boyfriend (I'm in a poly) and we stayed at the Chelsea Hotel. Neither of us knew how high class that place was. We were severely underdressed for that place.</p>

  <h3>Meeting Damon</h3>
    <p>Though Adventures in Wonderland yanked most of our perks, we still got to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Albarn" target="_blank">Damon Albarn, singer of Gorillaz</a>. He's not going to remember my name or face, but I did leave him a photo album full of positive notes from fans.</p>

    <p>I gingerly stepped into the arena he was in for the pre-concert Sound Check show. There must have been no more than 75 of us. I had looked back to Emil and said "Look, it's him! It's really him!" It was so surreal to see an artist I admired less than 10 feet away from me. It was even more interesting to hear him in the distance as we approached the arena entrance, we could hear his voice get louder before we could see him playing to himself, front in center. The lights were purple.</p>

    <p>The first song he decided to play for us with the band was Magic City. Seye's bass would rumble into your very core, you'd feel the bass vibrating your spine. The bass drum hit my chest so hard I could feel my heart shift its beat more than once.</p>

    <p>The song faded and Damon smiled. Emil and I waved, and he waved back to us with a smile that showed off that gold tooth of his.</p>

    <p>Damon must've played Souk Eye for half an hour or more.</p>

    <p>I remember vividly where he had finally finished that song and he contemplated Kids With Guns. "But I don't know..." He murmured. The crowd cheered.</p>

    <p>I mustered the courage to shout. "Kids With Guns is tea and you should play it!" A wave of laughter swept the crowd, I even got a laugh out of Damon. When something is "tea", it means that the thing makes a powerful political statement. Once he finished his chortling, he smiled and said "Thank you".</p>

    <p>During Lake Zurich, an instrumental song, Damon sat down on the stage and started kicking his legs around as he dangled about 7 feet off the ground. Emil shouted hello, and Damon waved and greeted him back. We never got a chance to get our tickets signed. Someone held him up elsewhere.</p>

    <p>No one told Damon the show was ending. He was dancing about and his back was turned to us, so he didn't see security begin to escort everyone out. When he turned around, he saw half of us gone, and the other half being hurried away. And his face sort of fell. "Oh... You're leaving?" he asked. I almost hoped that meant he'd round us back to the stage! "I'm sorry, I would've said goodbye if I had known..." he added, face falling quite a bit.</p>

    <p>That was a side I was aware of and was worried about, because Damon had been sounding more and more depressed lately. I could almost see him kinda beating himself up from across the arena. I shouted "You did a great job Damon!!" and Emil shouted "We love you Damon!!"</p>

    <p>And it was kind of... emotional. It was emotional to see that lighten his face as he looked to us two and said "I love you too!"</p>

    <p>I think a lot about that. Maybe it's weird that I do. It just means a lot, knowing that Damon's hurting and that we, as fans, could do something to make him smile.</p>

    <p>It's gonna hurt, waiting 10 years.</p>
